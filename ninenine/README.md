bunch of junk. i've forgotten a bunch of the stdlib, and want it back.

so some sample problems here
https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/1_to_10
First pass is lib, not really using stdlib or anything, and just putstrln'ing results.

lots of goofing around with configuration to get things fancier. This should probably go in changelog, anyway
next round will be real hspec, maybe a typeclass per batch of 10, a simple direct implementation, and fancy pants
folds kinda implementation. some of these are trivial with stuff like concatmap. In some sense, they're all trivial, but like, it's good to write the direct implementation from time to time.
